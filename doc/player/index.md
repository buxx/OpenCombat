### Deployment phase

This phase let you all time you need to place your troops. You must think about two things:

- Your soldiers are they in secured place ? Avoid places where they can be shoot when battle will start
- Your soldiers will be able to make tactical move to conquer the map ?

You can place them in the lighted area. Dark area is the opponent placement zone.

#### How place the troops

To move troops, drag'n drop soldiers with the `left-click`.

#### Prepare some orders

You can give orders to squads. See following [Orders section](#orders). These orders will be executed only when battle start.

ðŸ’¡ *Note*: Unless you want your squad move/sneak immediately when battle start, choose `Hide` order is a good choice to prevent your soldiers from being seen at the start of the battle.
